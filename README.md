# MyReads Project

What a fantastic choice you've made to manage your reading list with the MyReads Project. Why use a kindle and a wishlist on Amazon when you can use this? am I right?

This application will allow you to manage the books you are currently reading, would like to read, and have read. Killer!

To use the application, perform the following steps after you have cloned the repo:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## What You're Getting
Only the best React application ever built. Like totally!

## Enjoy and be careful out there
